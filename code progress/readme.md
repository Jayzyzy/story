## This article is aimed to record my progress in code learning

as a student major in chemistry, thanks to Shanghaitech, I get plenty of resources in code learning. Since the SI100b course taken, my coding comprehension got better.

While the class in CS major in Shanghaitech  is still too academic and lack of usability, so I took a lot of online course to get knoeledgeof different language in coding. These are:

- Python , the most powerful language, which has a lot of package to let me do many things quickly.
- Julia, a language using in Scientific Culculation. 
- C,C++, the most important language
- html
- CSS
- PHP
- java
- shell
- SQL
- linux
- latex
- markdown
- Walfram
- R
- js

In my next trip, I will try to get used to Android Development. Hope my own app will soon be pushed online.
